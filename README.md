# Hannstats

Welcome to the repo for the Hannstats video project, a quantitative look at character in the Hannibal fandom. This project was completed for a seminar in modern television at McGill University taught by prof [Lynn Kozak](https://www.mcgill.ca/history/lynn-kozak).

The repo contains all data used in the video, scripts used to produce the results in the video, and an installable library with helper functions for the scripts.

[You can watch the video here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=latsmREz_SU) Enjoy :)
